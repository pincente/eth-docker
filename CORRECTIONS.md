# Correction of Incorrect Whiptail UI Mentions

## Issue Identified
In the modularization project, several TODO messages incorrectly mentioned "with whiptail UI" when they should simply indicate that the full implementation needs to be done. This was misleading as:

1. Only the config command uses whiptail UI (as a wizard)
2. All other commands should be refactored exactly as they are in the monolith
3. No added features or changes should be made to the functionality

## Files Corrected
The following files had incorrect TODO messages that were corrected:

- `modules/commands/config/consensus.sh`
- `modules/commands/config/network.sh`
- `modules/commands/config/lido.sh`
- `modules/commands/config/history.sh`
- `modules/commands/config/ssv.sh`
- `modules/commands/config/validator.sh`
- `modules/commands/config/graffiti.sh`
- `modules/commands/config/execution.sh`
- `modules/commands/config/legacy.sh`
- `modules/commands/config/checkpoint.sh`
- `modules/commands/config/remote.sh`
- `modules/commands/config/coinbase.sh`
- `modules/commands/config/grafana.sh`
- `modules/commands/config/mev.sh`

## Correction Made
Changed all instances of:
```
TODO: Implement full __function_name with whiptail UI
```

To:
```
TODO: Implement full __function_name
```

## Verification
- All tests still pass successfully
- TODO messages in test output now correctly reflect the work needed
- No functionality was changed, only the misleading comments were corrected
- The project still maintains its focus on exact refactoring without added features

## Project Principles Reaffirmed
1. **No UI Implementation** - This project does not implement whiptail UIs (except for the config wizard)
2. **Exact Refactoring** - Functions are refactored exactly as they appear in the monolith
3. **No Added Features** - No changes to functionality are made during refactoring
4. **Placeholder Approach** - Functions return default values for testing purposes
5. **Backward Compatibility** - All existing functionality works unchanged
